# Penmark OAuth

This project is the piece which enables the [penmark package](https://github.com/penmark-cms/penmark). 
It is responsible for handling the GitHub OAuth flow and redirects.

It is an Azure Functions project, heavily inspired by [utterances](https://github.com/utterance/utterances-oauth).
